                       <h2>World Tour Finals Preview: PV Sindhu, recharged and battle ready</h2>
                       <h5>With the Indian having played more matches than other top players, 
                           taking a break last year was a wise decision.</h5>
                           <p>Carolina Marin (50 total) played 24 tournaments fewer than PV Sindhu 
                               (74) for four whole seasons from 2016 to 2019. 
                               That’s an average of 6 less than the Indian every year. Add to that
                                the air-travel time hopping countries and the official tour’s media 
                                and sponsorship commitments, which can be a drain on energy reserves.</p>
                               
                                <p>The Indian avoided Marin in the group draw at World Tour Finals, the 
                                    season finale, which begins on Wednesday. Sindhu has World No.1 Tai 
                                    Tzu Ying (Chinese Taipei), home favourite Ratchanok Intanon and
                                     Pornpawee Chochuwong. Sindhu’s nowhere near her best – nor expected
                                      to be if the Olympics are the target as she will want to peak in Tokyo. </p>
