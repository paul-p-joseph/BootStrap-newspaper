                            Iga Swiatek says she found peace on court after a couple of chaotic months
                             following her French Open win and the 19-year-old is sharpening the mental 
                             side of her game to deal with the expectation that comes with a Grand Slam trophy.
                        </p>

                        <p>The Pole went from being a largely unknown teenager ranked 54th in the world to 
                            acquiring celebrity status when she won the title at Roland Garros in October.</p>

                            Swiatek, who will begin her season in Melbourne at a WTA tune-up event ahead of 
                            the Australian Open, was still feeling the changes in her life as she toiled
                             through her pre-season in December in Tenerife, southern Spain.
                            </p>

                            <p>She subsequently climbed to a career-high 17th in the rankings and was voted
                                 the most improved player and fan favourite in the WTA awards.</p>

                <h2>Wicketkeeping a specialist position in Tests, one missed
                     chance can change a match: Wriddhiman Saha</h2>

                <div class="col-4">
                    <p>Wriddhiman Saha said he does not feel any pressure because 
                        of Rishabh Pant’s form with the bat because he thinks of 
                        himself as a specialist wicketkeeper. Saha had been picked
                         for the 1st Test vs Australia in the recent series, but 
                         Pant was preferred over him in the subsequent matches after
                          Saha scored 9 and 4 in the match. Pant eventually went on 
                          to play a leading role in India’s 2-1 series victory.</p>

                          <p>“I have been hearing these comparisons since 2018. 
                              I believe in doing my job and I am not worried 
                              about how Pant is batting. I don’t want to change
                               my game because of that. It’s up to the team management
                                to decide who will stand behind the stumps,” Saha told TOI.</p>

                         new meet record at the U-20 Federation Cup at Bhopal on Monday,
                          he wasn’t particularly elated. The 19-year-old, who overtook 
                          Neeraj Chopra’s meet record of 76.91m with a best attempt of 
                          78.68m, wasn’t satisfied with his effort, nor was his father

                                So it’s not really an occasion to celebrate,” Rai Singh says.</p>
